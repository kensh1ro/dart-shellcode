# dart-shellcode
A PoC executing shellcode in Dart.
This project shows that Dart can be used in Red teaming and Implant development (e.g. a C2 framework can be written 100% with dart)

Security products are not good with analyzing Dart, and they won't be anytime soon, so this will probably stay FUD for a long time.

#### Note: this was a painful experience to get this to work (Dart really sucks in FFI).
